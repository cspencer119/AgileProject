# AgileProject

This is a project by Ethan, Hayden and Cyrus. 

Our goal was to create a app for a user to be able to search through different animals and learn about them. 

Our MVP is : This app should allow the user to see the list of animals in the system. The user should be able to see individual animals from the groups as well as by the groups themselves. The user should then be able to add and remove animals to the existing list at their discretion. 

We used Trello for our project. Our trello link is https://trello.com/b/jNpfpsNi/agile-project .
